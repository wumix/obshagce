    The Official Blueberry Soft Hypermedia Adventure Game
                    Construction Engine
----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------
 Hi!
 
 This is a little framework / template thing I'm working on
 for building hypermedia adventure games--simple
 collections of HTML and CSS and whatever media you want to
 stick in there.
 
 I've tried to keep things easy to understand, so avoided
 Javascript and any ideas about trying to keep it as one
 page (EVIL). The only thing that's kinda dynamic (?) is
 the status window, which is a frame. Otherwise each board
 is it's own HTML page with some inline CSS. There's a
 general (base.css) style sheet too.
 
 I hope this will encourage people to make more cool,
 personal websites. And explore the possabilites of a
 JS-free WWW.

                           Goals
----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------

 - Easy to read markup (with comments).
 - Be a useful earning tool for HTML and CSS.
 - No Java Script
   (but feel free to fork if you're into that).
 - Help show games can use simple technologies.
 - Promote cool, simple hypermedia.

                     Style Sheet Stuffs
----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------

 Trying to explain the purpose / use of the IDs and
 classes used.

 IDs
 
 'splashimage'	For title screen images.
 
 'windows'		

 Classes

 'board'		References the main game board.
 
 'heading'		
 
 'senses'		
 
 'sensed'		
 
 'title'		

 'window'		References elements that make up the main
 				three windows, but exludes their contents.

 Also included at the end of 'base.css' are some clases you
 can apply for graphic effects. For example alignment and
 rotation.
 
 'align_*'		For easily alligning things in cells.
 
 'empty'		To make a cell as empty. It removes the
 				border, so if used in the main game board
				the cell will not be indented.
 
 'no_scale'		For images you don't want to scale to fill
				a cell.
 
 'rotate_*'		For rotating elements, in 90 degree
				increments.
